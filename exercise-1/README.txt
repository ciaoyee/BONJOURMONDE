I am going to complete this exercise hopefully by 0900 on January 11, 2017. The goals of this exercise are to get more familiar with the terminal, git, and github. There is also the goal of remembering more commands and be able to navigate more quickly. 

I love to eat sushi and also korean food, so one of my favorite restaurants is Gushi. It's also a really good deal for the amount that you pay.
